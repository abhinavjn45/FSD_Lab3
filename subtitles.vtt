[Music]

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.120
We came here looking for lost worlds. We

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.920
found one. You've taken me to places

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.559
I've never

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.439
seen. Show me the animals in my

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.000
dreams. More people have been into space

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.720
and visited this this insanely magical

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.000
place.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.599
The idea of doing something where

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.239
nobody's ever set foot before. The

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.800
fragile earth.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.160
This precious life. And he can cover

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.520
this distance in a matter of seconds.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.039
These are literally the last two

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.440
northern white runners in existence. You

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.239
searched for the truth, shown me the

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.480
light, and held my hand through the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.239
night.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.199
Amazing.

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.840
You've shown me the colors of the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.800
rainbow, the wonder of the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.840
seas, and gone to the ends of the earth

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.000
for me. I don't think there's anywhere

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.320
else on earth where you feel quite so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.360
small. So I can run with the pack.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.280
Welcome back everyone. The timid and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.720
small to the very biggest of them all.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.240
We face danger together. Without

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.040
volcanoes, there wouldn't be life. We

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040
looked into the abyss. It's been

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.520
isolated for so long. I followed in your

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.960
footsteps through all of this.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.360
The tigers are going to absolutely love

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.720
it. I've seen you fly.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.680
You're one of the closest

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.799
you thing that sets us apart is our

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.920
desire to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.680
explore. This place is what adventures

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.180
are made of.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.319
[Music]

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.399
And we've been true to nature through it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.399
all.
